SpoutPlugin
===========
SpoutPlugin (formerly BukkitContrib) is a plugin for [Bukkit](http://www.bukkit.org), which extends the Bukkit API to provide features that aren't normally available. SpoutPlugin is a legacy project, and will be replaced by the [Spout voxel game platform](https://github.com/SpoutDev/Spout) when finished.
